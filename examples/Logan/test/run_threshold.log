Threshold version 5.3.9
Input file test/logan.ssa.tif has projected coordinate system.
This run may take on the order of 1 minutes to complete.
This estimate is very approximate. 
Run time is highly uncertain as it depends on the complexity of the input data 
and speed and memory of the computer. This estimate is based on our testing on 
a dual quad core Dell Xeon E5405 2.0GHz PC with 16GB RAM.
Nodata value input to create partition from file: -1.000000
Nodata value recast to float used in partition raster: -1.000000
Compute time: 0.002293
